The results validate the distributive laws and DeMorgan’s laws:

Distributive Laws:
For A \cup (B \cap C)A∪(B∩C) and (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)(A∪B)∩(A∪C), both sides yield the set \{1, 2, 3, 4\}{1,2,3,4}, confirming the Distributive Law of Union over Intersection.
For A \cap (B \cup C)A∩(B∪C) and (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)(A∩B)∪(A∩C), both sides yield the set \{2, 3\}{2,3}, confirming the Distributive Law of Intersection over Union.
DeMorgan’s Laws:
For \overline{A \cup B} 
A∪B
  and \overline{A} \cap \overline{B} 
A
 ∩ 
B
 , both sides yield the set \{0, 5\}{0,5}, confirming the First Law of DeMorgan.
For \overline{A \cap B} 
A∩B
  and \overline{A} \cup \overline{B} 
A
 ∪ 
B
 , both sides yield the set \{0, 1, 4, 5\}{0,1,4,5}, confirming the Second Law of DeMorgan.
These results confirm the distributive laws for ∪ and ∩ and DeMorgan’s laws.
