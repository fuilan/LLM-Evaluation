"prompt": We want to proof that the trace of a matrix is the sum of its eigenvalues. By definition, the characteristic polynomial of an $n\\times n$ matrix $A$ is given by \n$$p(t) = \\det(A-tI) = (-1)^n \\big(t^n - (\\text{tr} A) \\,t^{n-1} + \\dots + (-1)^n \\det A\\big)\\,.$$\nCan you finish the proof?
"output": To prove that the trace of a matrix is the sum of its eigenvalues, we can use the characteristic polynomial of the matrix. The characteristic polynomial \( p(t) \) of an \( n \times n \) matrix \( A \) is given by:
\[ p(t) = \det(A - tI) \]
where \( I \) is the identity matrix of the same size as \( A \), and \( t \) is a scalar. The polynomial is of degree \( n \) and can be expressed as:
\[ p(t) = (-1)^n (t^n - \text{tr}(A) \, t^{n-1} + \dots + (-1)^n \det(A)) \]
The coefficients of \( p(t) \) are functions of the trace of \( A \) (the sum of the diagonal elements) and the determinant of \( A \).
Now, the eigenvalues of \( A \) are the roots of the characteristic polynomial \( p(t) \). That is, if \( \lambda \) is an eigenvalue of \( A \), then \( p(\lambda) = 0 \).
The coefficient of \( t^{n-1} \) in \( p(t) \) is \( -\text{tr}(A) \) by the expansion of the determinant. However, the coefficient of \( t^{n-1} \) is also the negative sum of the eigenvalues of \( A \) (counting multiplicity), because the characteristic polynomial can be written as:
\[ p(t) = (t - \lambda_1)(t - \lambda_2) \dots (t - \lambda_n) \]
Expanding this product, the coefficient of \( t^{n-1} \) is \( -(\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \dots + \lambda_n) \).
Therefore, we have:
\[ \text{tr}(A) = \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \dots + \lambda_n \]
This equation shows that the trace of a matrix is indeed the sum of its eigenvalues, counting multiplicity. This completes the proof.

"output": The Mean Value Theorem (MVT) states that for a function \( f \) that is continuous on the closed interval \( [a, b] \) and differentiable on the open interval \( (a, b) \), there exists a point \( c \) in \( (a, b) \) such that:
\[ f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} \]
In this case, we apply the MVT to the interval \( [a, a+h] \) for \( h > 0 \). We know \( a < c_h < a+h \), so the MVT gives us:
\[ f'(c_h) = \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \]
Now, taking the limit as \( h \rightarrow 0^+ \), we get:
\[ \lim_{h \rightarrow 0^+} f'(c_h) = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0^+} \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \]
Given that \( c_h \rightarrow a^+ \) as \( h \rightarrow 0^+ \), and knowing that \( \lim_{x \rightarrow a^+} f'(x) \) exists, we can use the continuity of the derivative to conclude:
\[ \lim_{h \rightarrow 0^+} \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} = \lim_{x \rightarrow a^+} f'(x) \]
Therefore, \( f \) is differentiable at \( a \), and \( f'(a) = \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f'(x) \).

"output": The result used in the [MISSING] part is the Mean Value Theorem (MVT).

\[ f'(ξ) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} \]
In the context of your question, we apply the Mean Value Theorem to the interval \( [y, x] \) (assuming \( y < x \)) to get:
\[ f'(ξ) = \frac{f(x) - f(y)}{x - y} \]
for some \( ξ \) in \( (y, x) \). This is the missing equation you referred to. Then, by taking absolute values and using the fact that \( f' \) is bounded by a constant \( C \) on the compact interval \( [a, b] \), we obtain the Lipschitz condition:
\[ |f(x) - f(y)| \leq C |x - y| \]
which shows that \( f \) satisfies a Lipschitz condition on \( [a, b] \).

Consider the set consisting of the logs of all primes $\\, p_i.\\,$ If $ \\, c_1 \\log p_1 +\\,\\cdots\\, + c_n\\log p_n =\\, 0,\\  c_i\\in\\mathbb Q,\\,$ multiplying by a common denominator we can assume that all $\\ c_i \\in \\mathbb Z\\,$.

"output": To finish the proof, we need to show that the set of logarithms of prime numbers, \(\{\log p_i\}\), where \(p_i\) is a prime, is an infinite linearly independent set over \(\mathbb{Q}\). This will imply that the vector space of \(\mathbb{R}\) over \(\mathbb{Q}\) is infinite-dimensional.
Suppose that we have a finite set of primes \(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n\) and a linear combination:
\[ c_1 \log p_1 + c_2 \log p_2 + \cdots + c_n \log p_n = 0 \]
where \(c_i \in \mathbb{Z}\) are the coefficients. We can clear the denominators as you mentioned, so we can assume that the \(c_i\) are integers.
Now, if this linear combination is equal to zero, it means that the logarithms are linearly dependent over \(\mathbb{Q}\). However, we know that logarithms of different primes are transcendental and therefore linearly independent over \(\mathbb{Q}\). This is a consequence of the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem, which states that if \(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n\) are algebraic numbers that are linearly independent over \(\mathbb{Q}\), then they are also linearly independent over \(\mathbb{Q}\) when considering their exponentials, i.e., \(e^{\alpha_1}, \ldots, e^{\alpha_n}\).
Since the logarithms of the primes are transcendental, we have that:
\[ c_1 \log p_1 + c_2 \log p_2 + \cdots + c_n \log p_n = 0 \implies c_1 = c_2 = \cdots = c_n = 0 \]
This means that the set \(\{\log p_i\}\) is linearly independent over \(\mathbb{Q}\). Since there are infinitely many primes, this set forms an infinite linearly independent set over \(\mathbb{Q}\), and thus the vector space of \(\mathbb{R}\) over \(\mathbb{Q}\) is infinite-dimensional.

"prompt": $F$ is a finite field of order $q$. We want to compute the size of $\\operatorname{GL}_n(F)$. In order for an $n \\times n$ matrix to be invertible, we need the rows to be linearly independent. We have $q^n - 1$ choices for the first row; now, there are $q$ vectors in the span of the first row, so we have $q^n - q$ choices for the second row. Can you finish the proof?
"output": To compute the size of \operatorname{GL}_n(F), the group of n \times nn×n invertible matrices over the finite field F of order q, we need to count the number of ways we can choose linearly independent rows for the matrix.
For the first row, we have q^n - 1 choices because any non-zero vector in F^n will do, and there are q^n - 1 non-zero vectors.
For the second row, we need to avoid choosing a vector that is in the span of the first row. Since the span of a single vector is a one-dimensional space, it contains exactly q vectors (the non-zero scalar multiples of the first row). Therefore, we have q^n - q choices for the second row.
For the third row, we need to avoid choosing a vector that is in the span of the first two rows. The span of two linearly independent vectors is a two-dimensional space, and in a vector space of dimension n, a two-dimensional subspace can contain at most q^2 vectors. Thus, we have q^n - q^2 choices for the third row.
Continuing this pattern, for the i-th row, we need to avoid choosing a vector that is in the span of the first i-1 rows. The span of i-1 linearly independent vectors is a (i-1)-dimensional space, and in a vector space of dimension n, a (i-1)-dimensional subspace can contain at most q^{i-1} vectors. Therefore, we have q^n - q^{i-1} choices for the i-th row.
Since we are choosing each row independently, the total number of ways to choose all nn rows is the product of the number of choices for each row. Thus, the size of \operatorname{GL}_n(F) is:
(q^n - 1)(q^n - q)(q^n - q^2) \cdots (q^n - q^{n-1})
This product can be simplified as follows:
(q^n - 1)(q^n - q)(q^n - q^2) \cdots (q^n - q^{n-1}) = \frac{(q^n)!}{q^n \cdot (q^{n-1})!}
Here, (q^n)! is the factorial of q^n, and (q^{n-1})!(qn−1)! is the factorial of q^{n-1}. The q^n in the denominator cancels out with one of the factors in the numerator, leaving:
\frac{(q^n)!}{q^n \cdot (q^{n-1})!} = \frac{(q^n)!}{(q^{n-1})! \cdot q^n} = \frac{(q^n)!}{(q^n)^n}
Finally, since (q^n)! is the product of all positive integers up to q^n, which includes q^n itself, we can cancel out the q^n terms in the numerator and denominator, leaving:
\frac{(q^n)!}{(q^n)^n} = (q^n - q)(q^n - q^2) \cdots (q^n - q^{n-1})
This product is equal to the size of \operatorname{GL}_n(F), which is the number of n \times n invertible matrices over the finite field F of order q.

If $v$ is an eigenvector of $AB$ for some nonzero $\\lambda$, then $Bv\\ne0$\nand $$\\lambda Bv=B(ABv)=(BA)Bv,$$ so $Bv$ is an eigenvector for $BA$ with the same eigenvalue. Can you finish the proof?
"output": To finish the proof, we need to show that every eigenvalue of AB is also an eigenvalue of BA, and vice versa. We have already shown that if v is an eigenvector of AB with eigenvalue \lambda, then Bv is an eigenvector of BA with the same eigenvalue \lambda.
Now, let’s consider an eigenvector w of BA with eigenvalue \mu. We want to show that \mu is also an eigenvalue of AB. Since w is an eigenvector of BA, we have:
BAw = \mu w
Multiplying both sides of this equation by B^{-1} (assuming B is invertible, which is necessary for the eigenvalues to be well-defined), we get:
A(Bw) = \mu B^{-1}w
Let’s denote Bw by v. Then we have:
Av = \mu B^{-1}w
Since B is invertible, B^{-1}w is a nonzero vector (because w is an eigenvector and thus nonzero). Therefore, v = Bw is an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue \mu. This means that \mu is an eigenvalue of AB.
We have shown that every eigenvalue of AB is also an eigenvalue of BA, and every eigenvalue of BA is also an eigenvalue of AB. Therefore, the eigenvalues of AB and BA are exactly the same, which completes the proof.

"output": To complete the proof, we need to show that if the vectors v_i are linearly dependent, then the Gram matrix G is not invertible, and thus its determinant |G| = 0.
Let A be the matrix whose columns are the vectors v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n, so that G = A^T A. If the vectors v_i​ are linearly dependent, there exists a vector u \neq 0 such that A u = 0. This implies that u is in the null space of A.
Since u \neq 0, the null space of A is a proper subspace of \mathbb{R}^n. Therefore, the columns of A are not linearly independent, and thus A is not of full rank.
Now, consider the matrix G = A^T A. Since A is not of full rank, G is also not of full rank. This means that G is not invertible.
Finally, since G is not invertible, its determinant |G| must be zero. This completes the proof that if the vectors v_i are linearly dependent, then |G| = 0.

If $x-\\delta < t <x$, then\n[MISSING].\nLetting $t\\to x$, we see that $f'(x) \\ge 0$. Can you fill in the missing equation?
"output": To prove the result, we can use the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) for Integrals, which states that if a function f is continuous on the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists a point c in (a, b) such that:
f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}
Since f has a local maximum at x and f'(x) exists, by the Mean Value Theorem, there exists a point c in the \delta neighborhood of x such that:
f'(c) = \frac{f(x+\delta) - f(x)}{x+\delta - x}
Now, for x-\delta < t < x, we have:
f(t) < f(x)
This means that the area under the graph of f between x-\delta and t is less than the area between x and x+\delta. Integrating this property, we get:
\int_{x-\delta}^{x} f(t) \, dt < \int_{x}^{x+\delta} f(t) \, dt
Now, by the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals, there exists a point s in (x-\delta, x) such that:
\int_{x-\delta}^{x} f(t) \, dt = f(x) - f(s)
And there exists a point t in (x, x+\delta) such that:
\int_{x}^{x+\delta} f(t) \, dt = f(t) - f(x)
Combining these two inequalities, we get:
f(x) - f(s) < f(t) - f(x)
Since s is between x-\delta and x, and t is between x and x+\delta, it follows that f(s) is less than or equal to f(x-\delta), and f(t) is greater than or equal to f(x). Therefore, we can simplify the inequality to:
f(x-\delta) < f(x)
Now, by the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals again, there exists a point rr in (x-\delta, x) such that:
f(x) - f(x-\delta) = f'(r)(x - (x-\delta))
Since r is between x-\delta and x, and x-\delta < x, it follows that f'(r) is positive. Therefore, we have:
f'(r) > 0
Since r can be taken arbitrarily close to x, it means that f'(x) must also be positive. However, this contradicts the fact that f has a local maximum at x. Therefore, f'(x) must be zero.
This completes the proof that if f has a local maximum at x and f'(x) exists, then f'(x) = 0.

"output": To define a suitable sequence \(\{ x_n \}\) such that \(f_n(x_n) = 1\) for each \(n\), we need to find values of \(x_n\) that satisfy the equation:
\[ f_n(x_n) = \frac{x_n^2}{x_n^2 + (1-nx_n)^2} = 1 \]
This equation simplifies to:
\[ x_n^2 = x_n^2 + (1-nx_n)^2 \]
We can solve for \(x_n\) by rearranging the equation:
\[ 0 = (1-nx_n)^2 \]
Since \(x_n\) must be nonnegative and \(n\) is a positive integer, the only solution that makes sense in the context of the interval \(0 \leq x \leq 1\) is:
\[ nx_n = 1 \]
Thus, we can define the sequence \(\{ x_n \}\) by:
\[ x_n = \frac{1}{n} \]
For this sequence, we have:
\[ f_n(x_n) = f_n\left(\frac{1}{n}\right) = \frac{\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)^2}{\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)^2 + (1-n\left(\frac{1}{n}\right))^2} = \frac{\frac{1}{n^2}}{\frac{1}{n^2} + (1-1)^2} = \frac{1}{1} = 1 \]
Therefore, the sequence \(\{ x_n \} = \left\{ \frac{1}{n} \right\}\) satisfies \(f_n(x_n) = 1\) for each \(n\), and since \(\lim_{n\to\infty} f_n(x) = 0\) for \(0 \leq x \leq 1\), no subsequence of \(\{ f_n \}\) can converge uniformly on \([0,1]\).

"prompt": Let $f : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a differentiable function such that $f(0) = 1$ and $f'(x) = f(x)$. Then it must be the case that $f = e^x$. We will prove this statement in the following. \nLet $g(x) = f(x) e^{-x}$. Then $g$ is constant. But $g(0) = 1$, so $g(x) = 1$ identically. Can you show why $g$ is constant?
"output": To show that g(x) = f(x) e^{-x}is constant, we can use the fact that f'(x) = f(x). This derivative information will help us prove that g(x) does not change with x.
We start by calculating the derivative of g(x):
g'(x) = f'(x) e^{-x} - f(x) e^{-x} \cdot (-x)
Since f'(x) = f(x), we substitute this into the derivative:
g'(x) = f(x) e^{-x} - f(x) e^{-x} \cdot (-x) g'(x) = f(x) e^{-x} + f(x) e^{-x} \cdot x g'(x) = f(x) e^{-x} (1 + x)
Now, we use the fact that f(x) = g(x) e^xto express f(x) in terms of g(x):
f(x) = g(x) e^x f(x) = g(x) e^x \cdot x f(x) = g(x) x e^x
Substituting this back into g'(x), we get:
g'(x) = g(x) x e^x + g(x) e^x g'(x) = g(x) (x e^x + e^x)g'(x) = g(x) e^x (x + 1)
Since g(x) = f(x) e^{-x} and f(x) = g(x) e^x, we can substitute f(x) back into g(x):
g(x) = f(x) e^{-x}g(x) = g(x) e^x e^{-x}g(x) = g(x)
Thus, g(x) is a constant function. We know that g(0) = 1, so g(x) = 1 for all x.
Therefore, g is constant and equals 1, which implies f(x) = e^x because g(x) = f(x) e^{-x}
This completes the proof that f(x) = e^x.

"output": To show that T is a scalar multiple of the identity, we need to show that for any vector v, there exists a scalar \alpha such that Tv = \alpha v
Given a nontrivial linear functional f on V, there exists a vector xx such that f(x) \neq 0. Let SS be the linear operator defined by Sx = f(x) v.
Since TS = ST for all S, we have:
TS = ST
Substituting SS with Sx = f(x) v, we get:
T(f(x) v) = S(Tx)
Since T is a linear operator, T is a scalar multiple of x, say Tx = \alpha x. Therefore, S(Tx) = f(Tx) v
We also have T(f(x) v) = f(Tx) Tv
Now, equating these two expressions, we get:
f(Tx) v = f(Tx) 
Since ff is a nontrivial linear functional and Tx \neq 0, we can divide both sides by f(x) (which is non-zero) to get:
v = Tv
Therefore, Tv = \alpha v for all v, where \alpha is a scalar. This shows that T is a scalar multiple of the identity.

"prompt": Let $F$ be $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$. Suppose $a_0,\\dots,a_m\\in F$. If\n$$\na_0 + a_1z + \\dots + a_m z^m = 0\n$$\nfor every $z\\in F$, then $a_0=\\dots=a_m=0.$\n\nWe will prove the contrapositive. If not all the coefficients are $0$, then by changing $m$ we can assume $a_m \\neq 0$. Let\n$$\nz=\\frac{|a_0|+|a_1|+ \\dots + |a_{m-1}|}{|a_m|} + 1.\n$$\nNote that $z\\ge 1$, and thus $z^j \\le z^{m-1}$ for $j=0,1,\\dots,m-1$. Can you finish the proof?
"output": To finish the proof, we will show that if a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_m​ are not all zero, then there exists a zz such that a_0 + a_1z + \ldots + a_m z^m \neq 0, which contradicts our initial assumption.
Given a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_m​ and z as defined, we can rewrite the polynomial as:
a_0 + a_1 z + \ldots + a_m z^m = a_0 + a_1 \left( \frac{|a_0|+|a_1|+ \ldots + |a_{m-1}|}{|a_m|} + 1 \right) + \ldots + a_m 
Since a_m \neq 0, we can divide the entire polynomial by a_mam​ without changing the value of the polynomial at any z except for at z = 0, where the polynomial would be undefined. This gives us:
b_0 + b_1 z + \ldots + b_{m-1} z^{m-1} = 0
where b_j = \frac{a_j}{a_m}​ for j = 0, 1, \ldots, m-1
Now, we consider the effect of z on the polynomial b_0 + b_1 z + \ldots + b_{m-1} z^{m-1}. Since z \geq 1 and z^j \leq z^{m-1} for j = 0, 1, \ldots, m-1, the polynomial b_0 + b_1 z + \ldots + b_{m-1} z^{m-1} is strictly positive when z = 1 and strictly negative for all z > 1. This is because the leading term b_{m-1} z^{m-1}dominates the other terms as z increases.
Therefore, there exists a z > 1 such that b_0 + b_1 z + \ldots + b_{m-1} z^{m-1} is not zero. This contradicts our assumption that the polynomial equals zero for all z
Since the polynomial is not zero for some z > 1, and the original polynomial equals zero for all z, it must be the case that a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_m are all zero. This completes the proof.

"prompt": We want to proof that the trace of a matrix is the sum of its eigenvalues. For a $n\\times n$ matrix $A$ we define the polynomial\n$$p(t) = \\det(A-tI) = (-1)^n \\big(t^n - (\\text{tr} A) \\,t^{n-1} + \\dots + (-1)^n \\det A\\big)\\,.$$\nOn the other hand, $p(t) = (-1)^n(t-\\lambda_1)\\dots (t-\\lambda_n)$, where the $\\lambda_j$ are the eigenvalues of $A$.

"output": The polynomial p(t) you’ve described is known as the characteristic polynomial of the matrix A. The characteristic polynomial of an n \times n matrix A is given by:
p(t) = \det(A - tI)
where I is the n \times n identity matrix. This polynomial has deep connections to the eigenvalues of A, as you’ve noted. The roots of p(t) are exactly the eigenvalues of A, and comparing coefficients as you’ve done leads to the important relationship that the trace of A is the sum of its eigenvalues.

"prompt": Let $f$ have a continuous derivative on $[a,b]$. We want to show that $f$ satisfies a Lipschitz condition on $[a,b]$. By the mean value theorem, \n\n$$f(x) - f(y) = f'(\\xi)(x-y)$$ \nfor some $\\xi \\in (y,x)$. But since [MISSING], then $f'$ is bounded in that interval, say by $C$. Thus taking absolute values yields \n\n$$\\lvert f(x) - f(y)\\rvert \\le C \\lvert x-y\\rvert$$ \n\nCan you state the condition in [MISSING]?
"output": The condition in the missing part is that f has a continuous derivative on the interval [a, b]. This is because the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) states that if a function has a continuous derivative on an interval, then there exists a point \xi in that interval such that the derivative at that point equals the slope of the secant line between the function values at any two points in the interval.
So, the missing condition is that f has a continuous derivative on [a, b]. This allows us to conclude that f'′ is bounded in the interval, as stated in the proof.

"prompt": Let $f\\colon\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ and suppose that\n\n$$|f(x)-f(y)|\\le (x-y)^2$$\n\nfor all $x,y\\in\\mathbb{R}$. We want to prove that $f$ is constant. Let $c=f(0)$, then we have to prove that $f(x)=c$ whenever $x\\neq0$. Supposing that $n$ is an arbitrary positive integer, we have\n$$\\left|f\\left(\\frac{m+1}nx\\right)-f\\left(\\frac mnx\\right)\\right|\\le\\left(\\frac{m+1}nx-\\frac mnx\\right)^2=\\frac{x^2}{n^2}$$\nCan you finish the proof?
"output": To finish the proof, we need to show that for any positive integer nn, the difference between f \left( \frac{m+1}{n}x \right)f(nm+1​x) and f \left( \frac{m}{n}x \right)f(nm​x) is less than or equal to \frac{x^2}{n^2}n2x2​. This will allow us to conclude that ff is constant.
Given the inequality |f(x) - f(y)| \le (x - y)^2∣f(x)−f(y)∣≤(x−y)2 for all x, y \in \mathbb{R}x,y∈R, we can apply this to x = \frac{m+1}{n}xx=nm+1​x and y = \frac{m}{n}xy=nm​x:
|f\left(\frac{m+1}{n}x\right) - f\left(\frac{m}{n}x\right)| \le \left(\frac{m+1}{n}x - \frac{m}{n}x\right)^2∣f(nm+1​x)−f(nm​x)∣≤(nm+1​x−nm​x)2|f\left(\frac{m+1}{n}x\right) - f\left(\frac{m}{n}x\right)| \le \left(\frac{1}{n}x\right)^2∣f(nm+1​x)−f(nm​x)∣≤(n1​x)2|f\left(\frac{m+1}{n}x\right) - f\left(\frac{m}{n}x\right)| \le \frac{x^2}{n^2}∣f(nm+1​x)−f(nm​x)∣≤n2x2​
Now, we can use the triangle inequality for the absolute value:
\left| f\left(\frac{m+1}{n}x\right) - c \right| \le \left| f\left(\frac{m+1}{n}x\right) - f\left(\frac{m}{n}x\right) \right| + \left| f\left(\frac{m}{n}x\right) - c \right|​f(nm+1​x)−c​≤​f(nm+1​x)−f(nm​x)​+​f(nm​x)−c​\left| f\left(\frac{m+1}{n}x\right) - c \right| \le \frac{x^2}{n^2} + \left| f\left(\frac{m}{n}x\right) - c \right|​f(nm+1​x)−c​≤n2x2​+​f(nm​x)−c​
Let’s consider the sequence x_n = \frac{n}{m+1}xxn​=m+1n​x. As nn goes to infinity, x_nxn​ goes to zero. Using the inequality above, we can show that f \left( \frac{n}{m+1}x \right)f(m+1n​x) goes to cc as nn goes to infinity:
\left| f\left( \frac{n}{m+1}x \right) - c \right| \le \frac{x^2}{n^2} + \left| f\left( \frac{m}{n}x \right) - c \right|​f(m+1n​x)−c​≤n2x2​+​f(nm​x)−c​\left| f\left( \frac{n}{m+1}x \right) - c \right| \le \frac{x^2}{n^2} + \left| f\left( \frac{m}{n}x \right) - c \right|​f(m+1n​x)−c​≤n2x2​+​f(nm​x)−c​\left| f\left( \frac{n}{m+1}x \right) - c \right| \le \frac{x^2}{n^2} + \left| f\left( \frac{m}{n}x \right) - c \right|​f(m+1n​x)−c​≤n2x2​+​f(nm​x)−c​
As nn goes to infinity, \frac{x^2}{n^2}n2x2​ goes to zero. Therefore, \left| f\left( \frac{n}{m+1}x \right) - c \right|​f(m+1n​x)−c​ goes to zero, which means f \left( \frac{n}{m+1}x \right)f(m+1n​x) goes to cc as nn goes to infinity.
Since this holds for any positive integer nn, we can conclude that f \left( \frac{n}{m+1}x \right)f(m+1n​x) goes to cc for any x \neq 0x=0. This means f(x) = cf(x)=c whenever x \neq 0x=0, proving that ff is constant.

"prompt": We want to show that a finite dimensional vector space $V$ over a countable field $F$ is necessarily countable: if $v_1,\\ldots,v_n \\in V$ is a basis, then every vector in $V$ can be written uniquely as $\\alpha_1 v_1+\\cdots+\\alpha_n v_n$ for some scalars $\\alpha_1,\\ldots,\\alpha_n\\in F$. Can you finish the proof?
"output": To finish the proof, we need to show that since the field FF is countable, the set of all possible scalar multiples of the basis vectors v_1, \ldots, v_nv1​,…,vn​ is countable. This will imply that the set of all vectors in VV is countable.
Given a basis v_1, \ldots, v_nv1​,…,vn​ for VV, each vector in VV can be uniquely expressed as \alpha_1 v_1 + \cdots + \alpha_n v_nα1​v1​+⋯+αn​vn​ for some scalars \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_nα1​,…,αn​ in FF.
Since FF is countable, the set of all possible scalar multiples of v_1v1​ is countable, as it is just the set of all elements in FF. Similarly, the set of all possible scalar multiples of v_2v2​, v_3v3​, and so on, are also countable.
When we take the union of all these countable sets, we are considering all possible combinations of scalar multiples of the basis vectors. However, since there are only nn basis vectors and each basis vector can be multiplied by any element in the countable field FF, the total number of possible combinations is still countable.
Thus, the set of all vectors in VV is countable, as it can be represented as a countable union of countable sets.
This completes the proof that a finite-dimensional vector space VV over a countable field FF is necessarily countable.

This theorem states that for any vector uu in an inner product space and any non-zero vector vv, the square of the norm of uu is equal to the sum of the squares of the norms of the projections of uu onto vv and any orthogonal complement of vv.
In this case, ww is orthogonal to vv, so ww lies in the orthogonal complement of vv. The term \left\| \frac{\langle u, v \rangle}{\|v\|^2}v \right\|^2​∥v∥2⟨u,v⟩​v​2 represents the squared norm of the projection of uu onto vv, and \|w\|^2∥w∥2 represents the squared norm of ww, which is the component of uu that is orthogonal to vv. The Pythagorean theorem then shows that the sum of these two squared norms equals the squared norm of uu.

When $k\\to\\infty$, the Riemann sums will then tend to the value of this definite integral. Can you fill in the missing equation?
"output": To fill in the missing equation, we need to rewrite the given sum in a way that resembles a Riemann sum. The given sum is:
\lim_{k \to \infty} \sum_{n=k+1}^{2k} \frac{1}{n}k→∞lim​n=k+1∑2k​n1​
We can rewrite this sum as:
\lim_{k \to \infty} \sum_{n=k+1}^{2k} \left( \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n+1} \right)k→∞lim​n=k+1∑2k​(n1​−n+11​)
This rewriting allows us to identify the sum as a Riemann sum related to the definite integral:
\lim_{k \to \infty} \sum_{n=k+1}^{2k} \left( \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n+1} \right) = \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} + \cdots + \frac{1}{2k} - \frac{1}{2k+1} \right)k→∞lim​n=k+1∑2k​(n1​−n+11​)=k→∞lim​(1−21​+21​−31​+31​−41​+⋯+2k1​−2k+11​)
As kk approaches infinity, all terms except for the first and the last approach zero, and the sum simplifies to:
1 - \frac{1}{2k+1}1−2k+11​
Taking the limit as kk approaches infinity, we get:
\lim_{k \to \infty} 1 - \frac{1}{2k+1} = 1k→∞lim​1−2k+11​=1
Thus, the original sum converges to the value of the definite integral \int_1^2 \frac{1}{x} \, dx = \ln 2∫12​x1​dx=ln2 as kk approaches infinity.

"output": To finish the proof, we need to show that if the column vectors of AA are linearly dependent, then GG is not invertible.
Given that the column vectors of AA are linearly dependent, this means that there exists a non-zero vector vv such that Av = 0Av=0. This implies that vv is in the null space of AA, denoted as N(A)N(A).
Now, let’s consider the determinant of GG, which is given by |G| = \det(A^TA)∣G∣=det(ATA). Since G = A^TAG=ATA, we can write |G| = \det(A^TA) = \det(G)∣G∣=det(ATA)=det(G).
If GG is not invertible, it means that |G| = 0∣G∣=0. Given that vv is a non-zero vector in the null space of AA, we have Gv = 0Gv=0. Therefore, v^T G v = 0vTGv=0, which implies |G| = 0∣G∣=0.
Conversely, if |G| = 0∣G∣=0, then \det(G) = 0det(G)=0. This means that GG is not invertible, and since GG is the Gram matrix of AA, this implies that the column vectors of AA are linearly dependent.
Thus, we have shown that |G| = 0∣G∣=0 if and only if the vectors v_ivi​ are not linearly independent. This completes the proof.

Since ff is increasing, the set of points xx where f(x-) = r(x)f(x−)=r(x) is a decreasing sequence. This is because if x_1 < x_2x1​<x2​, then f(x_1-) \le f(x_2-)f(x1​−)≤f(x2​−), and since r(x_1) \neq r(x_2)r(x1​)=r(x2​), we have f(x_1-) < r(x_1)f(x1​−)<r(x1​) and f(x_2-) < r(x_2)f(x2​−)<r(x2​).
Since ff is increasing, the set of points xx where r(x) = f(x+)r(x)=f(x+) is also a decreasing sequence. This is because if x_1 < x_2x1​<x2​, then f(x_1+) \le f(x_2+)f(x1​+)≤f(x2​+), and since r(x_1) \neq r(x_2)r(x1​)=r(x2​), we have f(x_1+) < r(x_1)f(x1​+)<r(x1​) and f(x_2+) < r(x_2)f(x2​+)<r(x2​).
The set of discontinuities EE is the intersection of these two decreasing sequences. Since the intersection of two countable sets is countable, it follows that EE is at most countable.

The root test states that if \limsup_{n \to \infty} |a_n|^{1/n} < 1limsupn→∞​∣an​∣1/n<1, then the series \sum a_n∑an​ converges absolutely, and if \limsup_{n \to \infty} |a_n|^{1/n} > 1limsupn→∞​∣an​∣1/n>1, then the series \sum a_n∑an​ diverges.
Now, let’s apply the root test to the series \sum a_n∑an​:
\limsup_{n \to \infty} |a_n|^{1/n} = \limsup_{n \to \infty} |c_n z^n|^{1/n} = \limsup_{n \to \infty} |c_n|^{1/n} z^{1/n}n→∞limsup​∣an​∣1/n=n→∞limsup​∣cn​zn∣1/n=n→∞limsup​∣cn​∣1/nz1/n
Since zz is a complex number, z^{1/n}z1/n approaches 1 as n \to \inftyn→∞ if |z| = 1∣z∣=1, and approaches zz if |z| \neq 1∣z∣=1. Therefore, we can simplify the expression:
\limsup_{n \to \infty} |a_n|^{1/n} = \limsup_{n \to \infty} |c_n|^{1/n}n→∞limsup​∣an​∣1/n=n→∞limsup​∣cn​∣1/n
Given \alpha = \limsup_{n \to \infty} \sqrt[n]{|c_n|}α=limsupn→∞​n∣cn​∣​, we can write:
\limsup_{n \to \infty} |a_n|^{1/n} = \alphan→∞limsup​∣an​∣1/n=α
Now, let’s consider the two cases:
1.
If \alpha = 0α=0, then \limsup_{n \to \infty} |a_n|^{1/n} = 0limsupn→∞​∣an​∣1/n=0, and the root test implies that the series \sum a_n∑an​ converges absolutely. Since \sum a_n∑an​ is the series \sum c_n z^n∑cn​zn, and |z| < 1∣z∣<1, the series \sum c_n z^n∑cn​zn converges absolutely.
2.
3.
If \alpha = +\inftyα=+∞, then \limsup_{n \to \infty} |a_n|^{1/n} = +\inftylimsupn→∞​∣an​∣1/n=+∞, and the root test implies that the series \sum a_n∑an​ diverges. Since \sum a_n∑an​ is the series \sum c_n z^n∑cn​zn, and |z| > 1∣z∣>1, the series \sum c_n z^n∑cn​zn diverges.
4.
Thus, the series \sum c_n z^n∑cn​zn converges if |z| < 1/\alpha∣z∣<1/α and diverges if |z| > 1/\alpha∣z∣>1/α.
This completes the proof.

"prompt": Let $f : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a differentiable function such that $f(0) = 1$ and $f'(x) = f(x)$. Then it must be the case that $f = e^x$. We will prove this statement in the following.\nLet $g(x) = f(x) e^{-x}$. Then\n$$g'(x) = -f(x) e^{-x} + f'(x) e^{-x} = (f'(x) - f(x)) e^{-x} = 0$$\nby assumption. Can you finish the proof?
"output": To finish the proof, we need to show that since g'(x) = 0g′(x)=0 for all xx, g(x)g(x) must be a constant function.
Since g'(x) = 0g′(x)=0, this means that g(x)g(x) does not change with respect to xx, which implies that g(x)g(x) is constant.
We know that g(0) = f(0) e^{-0} = 1 \cdot 1 = 1g(0)=f(0)e−0=1⋅1=1. Therefore, g(x) = 1g(x)=1 for all xx.
Since g(x) = f(x) e^{-x}g(x)=f(x)e−x and g(x) = 1g(x)=1 for all xx, it follows that f(x) e^{-x} = 1f(x)e−x=1 for all xx.
Dividing both sides by e^{-x}e−x, we get:
f(x) = e^xf(x)=ex
This completes the proof that f(x) = e^xf(x)=ex.
